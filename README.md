# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures
- `list` contains Python implementation for linked lists and double linked list.
- `queueStructure` contains Python different implementations for queues based on linked lists and arrays.
- `stack` contains Python different implementations for stacks based on linked lists and arrays.
- `sorting` contains different sorting algorithm implemented in Python: selectionSort, insertionSort, bubbleSort, mergeSort, quickSort, heapSort and radixSort.
- `selection` contains some selection algorithms.
- `trees` contains binary tree, n-tree, AVL tree implementations. 
- `hashTable` contains
- `unionFind` contains 
- `binomialHeapRelax` contains a Python implementation of the binomial heap data structure. 
	With regular binomial heaps, every time the data structure is modified, a merging process is issued because only one <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_i"> tree is allowed in the forest.
	This particular implementation allowa to have more than one <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B_i"> tree. In fact, the merging process is executed only when a `deleteMin` operation is requested.
